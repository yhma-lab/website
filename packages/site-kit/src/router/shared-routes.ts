/**
 * The routes both sites publish, declared once.

 * Every entry names the languages that serve it, which is the whole point of the
 * table: the two apps used to carry the same fourteen route files and could drift
 * apart without saying so. A route that only one language should serve lists only
 * that language, and the registrar will refuse to build it for the other; a route
 * that needs a different component or param set per language is written as two
 * entries with disjoint `locales`.
 *
 * The paths are the ones the previous Hugo build published, and the components
 * read their language from `siteContext()`, so one entry serves both sites.
 *
 * Order matters: `/[...slugs]` is last because it claims only the paths the
 * entries above it have not.
